# Video Frame Reconstruction Challenge

##  Overview
A high-performance solution for reconstructing jumbled video frames using computer vision and optimization algorithms.  
This tool efficiently restores the original temporal sequence of shuffled video frames through advanced similarity analysis and parallel processing.

---

## Algorithm Approach

### Core Methodology
The reconstruction employs a similarity-based graph approach that leverages the principle of temporal coherence in video sequences.  
Consecutive frames in natural video exhibit minimal visual changes, allowing us to reconstruct the original sequence by identifying frames with maximum similarity.

## Technical Implementation

- **Similarity Analysis:** Uses *structural similarity* and *absolute difference* metrics on downscaled frame features.  
- **Graph Construction:** Frames represented as nodes in a complete graph with edge weights based on *dissimilarity scores*.  
- **Optimal Sequencing:** *Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)* algorithm finds the path connecting most similar frames.  
- **Parallel Processing:** *Multi-threaded computation* optimized for modern multi-core processors.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Accuracy:** High-quality reconstruction using full similarity analysis  
- **Speed:** 30â€“60 seconds for 300 frames on standard hardware  
- **Scalability:** Efficient algorithms suitable for various frame counts  
- **Parallelization:** Utilizes all available CPU cores for optimal performance
